# Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, Stability AI and LAION. It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on many consumer GPUs. See the model card for more information.
